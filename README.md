Before running the census_data.ipynb or census_dash.ipynb file, you will need to do the folling:

Get a an API key for the US Census Bureau APIs by visiting the following site:
    https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html

    Place API Key into the cell labeled for API Key

If you are unable to obtain a key through the Census Bureau, feel free to contact me through Slack (Derek Cassady)

Install the libraries found in the requirements.txt.  This will install the needed libraries for both .ipynb files in the project.

The census_data.ipynb file must be ran in its' entirity before the census_dash.ipynb file.
